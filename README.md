# Learning Python

Miscellaneous practice code in Python and things I've used. 

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

## Notes on Python built-ins worth knowing

## Run code linter

To run python linter `pylint` on a file (for example [`pylint_example.py`](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-python/blob/master/pylint_example.py)), run this in the CLI:
```bash
pylint pylint_example.py
```

Or even better, you can auto-run that command every time you save a file in the folder. To do that, do `pip3 install rerun` and then run this in the CLI:
```bash
rerun "pylint pylint_example.py"
```
