From these 42+27, choose 30.

## Essential: Memorize for fluency

### Commonly known

1. print
1. len
1. str
1. int
1. float
1. list
1. tuple
1. dict
1. set
1. range

### Often overlooked by beginners

1. sum
1. enumerate
1. zip
1. bool
1. reversed
1. sorted
1. min
1. max
1. any
1. all

And to make debugging easier:

1. breakpoint
1. dir
1. vars
1. type
1. help

## Specialized: Know about to find them effectively later

### Learn it later

1. open
1. input
1. repr
1. super
1. property
1. issubclass and isinstance
1. hasattr, getattr, setattr, and delattr
1. classmethod and staticmethod
1. next

### Maybe learn it eventually

1. iter
1. callable
1. filter and map
1. id, locals, and globals
1. round
1. divmod
1. bin, oct, and hex
1. abs
1. hash
1. object

## Arcane: Unlikely to need, but know they exist, just in case

### "You likely don't need these" (pretty specialized)

1. ord and chr
1. exec and eval
1. compile
1. slice
1. bytes, bytearray, and memoryview
1. ascii
1. frozenset
1. __import__
1. format
1. pow
1. complex
